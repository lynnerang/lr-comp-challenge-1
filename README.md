## General Info

<h4 align="middle">A project for practicing creating a UI from a flat mock using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JS for Turing's Front-End Engineering course, Module 1.</h4>


## Motivation

Static Comp #1 was a project I was assigned as a Mod 1 student at Turing.  We were given a flat mock with limited styling details (e.g. a few color hex codes) to reproduce from scratch in code.  This was primarily working with HTML and CSS, and we also had a chance to experiment with CSS media queries for making the design responsive and a touch of JavaScript to get the mobile version of global navigation to open and close when clicking the hamburger menu.  Here's the comp we were given:
